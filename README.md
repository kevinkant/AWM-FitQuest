# AWM-FitQuest
Project voor Advanced Web &amp; Mobile


Fitquest is a fitness app that helps you track your fitness journey. 

It focuses on 3 facets:
- Strength training with weights
- Bodyweight training
- High-Intensity-Interval-Training(HIIT) [In development]

There are multiple lists of default exercises to go through, with the option to add your own exercises, create your own routines and log all your workouts.

The workouts are stimulated with gamification elements, like quests and daily/weekly challenges. Each of those quests and challenges give you a specific amount of XP to level up your account
